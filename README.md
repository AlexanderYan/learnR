# learnR

#### Kun Ren

This book will bring you to the world of statistical computing and data analysis with R programming language. No matter whether you are a beginner or a user with experience, this book is intended for everyone who wishes to systematically learn the R programming language to be applied in statistics, econometrics, machine learning, financial computing, data processing, and visualization.

This book contains both introductory and advanced materials for R. It is not a text book for statistics and computer science. Therefore this book only gives external links to wikipedia for terminologies and will not cover too much on field-specific knowledge.

R is a powerful programming language and an environment for statistical computing, dataset exploration, analysis, and visualization. It is free, open-source and has a strong, rapidly growing community where users and developers share experience and actively contribute to the development of more than 5700 packages. 

*Notice: This book is an in-progress work and the contents are changing over time.*
