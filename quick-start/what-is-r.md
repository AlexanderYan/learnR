# What is R?

R is a powerful programming language and an environment for statistical computing, dataset exploration, analysis, and visualization. It is free, open-source and has a strong, rapidly growing community where users and developers share experience and actively contribute to the development of more than 5000 packages. 

Although R programming language dates back to 1993, its general adoption in data science research and industry has grown rapidly in the last few years, and several surveys shows that R is ranked as the number-one data science language.


In general, we don't only treat R as a programming language, but also as a comprehensive computing environment, a strong and active community, and a rapidly growing and expanding ecosystem.

#### Programming language

R, as a programming language, has been carefully designed and evolved in its development during the past 20 years. Its goal is rather clear: make it easy and flexible to perform comprehensive statistical computing, data exploration, and visualization. 

However, easiness and flexibility usually conflict with each other. This point is shown by many statistical software. It can be quite handy for users to click a few buttons to finish a variety of tasks, but it won't be flexible if one needs a bit customization, automation, reproducibility of the work. R stands out here for its well-positioned balance.

#### Computing environment

R, as a computing environment, is light-weight and ready to use. Compared to some other famous statistical software, e.g. Matlab, SAS, its software package is much smaller and easy to deploy. We will use RStudio to handle all the work in R. This integrated development environment provides rich features like syntax-highlighting, auto-completion, package management, graphics-viewer, help-viewer, environment-viewer, debugging, and etc., largely boosting the coding process.

#### Community

R, as a community, is strong and active. 

#### Ecosystem

R, as an ecosystem, is rapidly growing and expanding.
