R is a powerful programming language and an environment for statistical computing, dataset exploration, analysis, and visualization. It is free, open-source and has a strong, rapidly growing community where users and developers share experience and actively contribute to the development of more than 5000 packages. 

Although R programming language dates back to 1993, its general adoption in data science research and industry has grown rapidly in the last few years, and several surveys show that R is ranked as the number-one data science language.

In general, R should not be treated only as a programming language, but also as a comprehensive computing environment, a strong and active community, and a rapidly growing and expanding ecosystem.

#### Programming language

R, as a programming language, has been carefully designed and evolved in its development during the past 20 years. Its goal is rather clear: make it easy and flexible to perform comprehensive statistical computing, data exploration, and visualization. 

However, easiness and flexibility usually conflict with each other. This point is shown by many statistical software. It can be quite handy for users to click a few buttons to finish a variety of tasks, but it won't be flexible if one needs a bit customization, automation, reproducibility of the work. R stands out here for its well-positioned balance.

#### Computing environment

R, as a computing environment, is light-weight and ready to use. Compared to some other famous statistical software, e.g. Matlab and SAS, R is much smaller and easier to deploy. 

In this book, we will use RStudio to handle almost all the work in R. This integrated development environment provides rich features like syntax-highlighting, auto-completion, package management, graphics-viewer, help-viewer, environment-viewer, debugging, and etc., largely boosting the coding process.

#### Community

R, as a community, is strong and active. You can visit [Try R](http://tryr.codeschool.com/) and begin learning via this interactive tutorial. When you are coding, you probably won't solve every problem. Then you may Google your question any find that it almost always got answers in [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r). If your question is not fully addressed, you can ask it and probably get answered in a couple of minutes.

If you need to use a package but also want to see how it works, to report what might not work correctly, or to improve it, you can visit the source code at its online repository (or *repos*). Many repos are hosted by [GitHub](http://www.github.com).

#### Ecosystem

R, as an ecosystem, is rapidly growing and expanding in all data-related areas beyond IT industry. The majority of its users are not professional developers but data analysts, statisticians, econometricians. These users may not write the best-quality code, but they may contribute the cutting-edge tools to the ecosystem in R language, and all others have free 
access to these tools without reinventing the wheels.

For example, once an econometrician writes a package that includes a new method she found to detect a category of time series pattern, it may attract several users who find it interesting and useful. Then some professional users may improve the original code to make it faster and more general-purpose. A while later, some quantitative investor may find it helpful to incorporate this method into her trading strategy because it can detect patterns that usually causes risks in her portfolio. At the end of the day, the econometrician finds her tools applied in real-world industry, and the investor finds her portfolio less risky.

That is how the ecosystem works. And that is one of the reasons why R rocks in these areas: it has the ability to quickly turn the cutting-edge knowledge outside IT industry (usually data science academia and industry) to generally available and applicable tools in the ecosystem. In other words, it enables rapid conversion from data-science knowledge to productivity.
