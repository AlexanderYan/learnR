# Introduction

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Introduction to Markdown

Markdown is a documenting language with extremely light-weight syntax[^1]. Just type your document in plain texts and use simple operators to modify the style[^kb]. For example, *this text will be made italic to be emphasized* and **this text will be made bold**. To add a hyperlink^[Hyperlink is a string that directs you to a website.], just type [visit here](http://www.google.com).

## Equations

In this document we define $x$, $y$, and $z$ as the variables that jointly describe our model, which is formulated below.

$$ z^2=x^2+y^2 $$

This is an equation array like

\begin{align*}
x^2 + y^2 &= z^2 \\
x+y+z &= 1 \\
(x+y)(x-y) &= 1-z^2
\end{align*}

This is a numbered equation array like

\begin{align}
x^2 + y^2 &= z^2 \\
x+y+z &= 1 \\
(x+y)(x-y) &= 1-z^2
\end{align}

## Code

### Inline code

Here I define a symbol `x` to store the number vector, and `x <- rnorm(100)` creates a random numeric vector in which each number follows independent standard normal distribution, and assign the value to symbol `x`.

### Plain code block
Here is a code block

```

```

### R code block

```{r}
x <- rnorm(10)
x
```

Or named R code chunk

```{r chunk1}
plot(x,col="red")
```

Or R code chunk with meta arguments to control the size of the figure.

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=8}
x <- arima.sim(model = list(ar=0.5,ma=0.1),n = 300)
plot(x,main="Plot for x")
abline(h=quantile(x),col="red")
```

Or R plot in a partition.

```{r,fig.height=8, fig.width=8}
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- 2*x+rnorm(100)*0.5
m <- lm(y~x)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(m,ask=FALSE)
```
