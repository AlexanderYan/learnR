# Data frame

A data frame is a table with a number of rows and columns. It looks like a matrix but its columns are not necessarily the same type. This is consistent with most data tables: a row, or data record is described by multiple columns of different types.

The following example is a table that can be fully characterized by a data frame.

| Name     | Gender | Age | Major            |
|----------|--------|-----|------------------|
| Ken      | Male   | 24  | Finance          |
| Ashley   | Female | 25  | Statistics       |
| Jennifer | Female | 23  | Computer Science |

## Creating data frame

To create such a data frame, we can call `data.frame` function and supply the data in each column.

```{r}
df1 <- data.frame(Name=c("Ken","Ashley","Jennifer"),
  Gender=c("Male","Female","Female"),
  Age=c(24,25,23),
  Major=c("Finance","Statistics","Computer Science"))
df1
```

Note that creating a data frame is exactly the same with creating a list. It is because in essence a data frame *is* a list in which each list member represents a column and has the same number of elements.

```{r}
data.frame(id=1:5,x=c(0,2,1,-1,-3),y=c(0.5,0.2,0.1,0.5,0.9))
data.frame(id=1:10,x=runif(10),y=rnorm(10))
data.frame(id=1:5,name=c("A","A","B","B","C"),x=runif(5),y=rnorm(5))
data.frame(id=1:5,name=c("A","A","B","B","C"),x=runif(5),y=rnorm(5),stringsAsFactor=FALSE)

df1 <- data.frame(1:5,c("A","A","B","B","C"),rnorm(5))
colnames(df1) <- c("id","name","x")
rownames(df1) <- letters[1:5]

as.data.frame(matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9),nrow=3,byrow=FALSE))
```


## Subsetting data frame

In essence, data frame is nothing special but a list of vectors, each of which contains the same number of elements. Therefore, it has common features of both list and matrix.

```{r}
df1$id
df1[1]
df1["name"]
df1[c("id","name")]
df1[1:2]
df1[,"name"]
df1[,c("name","x")]
df1[,1:2]
df1[1:4,]
df1[1:4,"x"]
df1[1:4,c("id","x")]
df1[df1$x>=0,]
df1[df1$name=="A",]
```
