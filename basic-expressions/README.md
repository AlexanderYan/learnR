# Basic Expressions

Expressions are the building blocks of a function. R has a very clear-cut syntax that an expression is either a symbol or a function call.

Although everything we do is in essence implemented by function, R gives some functions special syntax so that it is more friendly to write  readable R code.

In the next few sections, we will see some of the fundamental expressions that are given special syntax:

- Assignment
- Condition
- Loop
